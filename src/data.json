    "desc": " Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions as a youth varied. After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs worked as a video game designer at Atari and later went to India to experience Buddhism. Steve Jobs was a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era. With Steve Wozniak, Jobs founded Apple Inc. in 1976 and transformed the company into a world leader in telecommunications. Widely considered a visionary and a genius, he oversaw the launch of such revolutionary products as the iPod and the iPhone. In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and the following year he underwent a major reconstructive surgery known as the Whipple operation. In 2009 Jobs received a liver transplant. In August 2011 he resigned as CEO of Apple, and two months later, at age 56, he died.",

    "desc": " Steve Wozniak, byname of Stephen Gary Wozniak, (born August 11, 1950, San Jose, California, U.S.), American electronics engineer, cofounder, with Steve Jobs, of Apple Computer, and designer of the first commercially successful personal computer. Wozniak—or “Woz,” as he was commonly known—was the son of an electrical engineer for the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale, California, in what would become known as Silicon Valley. A precocious but undisciplined student with a gift for mathematics and an interest in electronics, he attended the University of Colorado at Boulder for one year (1968–69) before dropping out. Following his return to California, he attended a local community college and then the University of California, Berkeley. In 1971 Wozniak designed the “Blue Box,” a device for phreaking (hacking into the telephone network without paying for long-distance calls) that he and Jobs, a student at his old high school whom he met about this time, began selling to other students. Also during the early 1970s Wozniak worked at several small electronics firms in the San Francisco Bay area before obtaining a position with the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1975, by which time he had formally dropped out of Berkeley. Wozniak also became involved with the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair 8800 microcomputer do-it-yourself kit, which was based on one of the world’s first microprocessors, the Intel Corporation 8080, released in 1975. While working as an engineering intern at Hewlett-Packard, Wozniak designed his own microcomputer in 1976 using the new microprocessor, but the company was not interested in developing his design. Jobs, who was also a Homebrew member, showed so much enthusiasm for Wozniak’s design that they decided to work together, forming their own company, Apple Computer. Their initial capital came from selling Jobs’s automobile and Wozniak’s programmable calculator, and they set up production in the Jobs family garage to build microcomputer circuit boards. This work ended in 1981 when he crashed his small airplane, leaving him temporarily with traumatic amnesia (unable to form new long-term memories), and he was forced to go on a sabbatical. He soon decided to return to Berkeley, under the pseudonym of Rocky Clark, in order to finish the computer science and electrical engineering courses needed to earn those degrees. Although he dropped out again, he eventually was given credit for his work at Apple, and the school awarded him a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in 1987. Wozniak returned to Apple in 1982, though he resisted efforts to involve him in management. He finally retired as an active employee in 1985, immediately after being awarded, along with Jobs, a National Medal of Technology by U.S. Pres. Ronald W. Reagan. Wozniak spent the ensuing decades engaged in philanthropic causes, especially involving the education of children, and in volunteer work teaching computer enrichment classes to preteens.",

    "desc": "Dennis M. Ritchie, (born September 9, 1941, Bronxville, Eastchester, New York, U.S.—found dead October 2011, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey), American computer scientist and cowinner of the 1983 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science. Ritchie and the American computer scientist Kenneth L. Thompson were cited jointly for “their development of generic soperating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system,” which they developed together at Bell Laboratories. Ritchie earned a bachelor’s degree (1963) in physics and a doctorate (1968) in mathematics from Harvard University. In 1967 he joined Bell Labs, where he first worked on the Multics operating system (OS). Multics was a time-sharing system funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and jointly developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric Co. However, AT&T Corporation (then the parent company of Bell Labs) withdrew from the project and removed its GE computers in 1969. Upon the removal of the GE machines, Ritchie joined Thompson in developing a more flexible operating system for Bell Lab’s obsolete Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-7 minicomputer. Within a few months they had created UNIX, a new OS not completely tied to any particular computer hardware, as earlier systems had been. In conjunction with the development of UNIX, Ritchie contributed somewhat to Thompson’s creation of the B programming language in 1970. As they moved their operating system to a newer PDP-11 minicomputer in 1971, the shortcomings of B became apparent, and Ritchie extended the language over the next year to create the C programming language. C and its family of languages, including C++ and Java, remain among the most widely used computer programming languages. In 1973 Ritchie and Thompson rewrote UNIX in C. Ritchie was named a fellow by Bell Labs in 1983 and was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 1988. In 1990 he was appointed head of the System Software Research Department at Bell Labs, where he led the development of the Plan 9 (1995) and Inferno (1996) operating systems. In 1998 Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology for their development of UNIX.",
